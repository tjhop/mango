# Mango Test Inventory

Small inventory for use with local testing and verifying functionality. Not necessarily intended to be used as a test suite, but by nature of testing functionalities, it may become one. As such, scripts in this inventory should avoid making permanent changes to the underlying system.

## Usage

See Makefile for help.
