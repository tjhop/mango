# Mango

Configuration **man**agement, in **go**... get it? Well, I tried.

Anyway, this repo is me building a toy configuration management engine in go, mostly for learning purposes.

Project/design goals:
- Compatibility with [aviary.sh's inventory format](https://github.com/frameable/aviary.sh)
- Each system manages itself via idempotent scripts/programs
- The daemon should be easy to analyze/inspect
    - [Pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) enabled
    - Native [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics
    - Structured logging
    - Grafana dashboard (Planned)

## Configuration Management

`Mango` is intended to be run as a daemon on the system that it will be managing.
`Mango` requires privileges to touch and manage the things you ask it to do (whether via your user when launching the service or a service manager like `Systemd`, that's up to you).
`Mango` is best used with an inventory controlled via git, for configuration as code.

### Inventory
`Mango`'s inventory is based on [aviary.sh's](https://github.com/frameable/aviary.sh) inventory.
Initially, `mango` will be an aviary.sh-compatible daemon, with configurations written as scripts/executables.

#### Inventory Setup
Please see [aviary.sh's documentation on inventory setup](https://github.com/frameable/aviary.sh#inventory-setup) for more information.

```
mkdir inventory
cd inventory
mkdir {hosts,modules,roles,directives}
touch {hosts,modules,roles,directives}/.gitkeep
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```
